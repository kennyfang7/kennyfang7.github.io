I recently built a tool called **[Stock News Sentiment](https://github.com/kennyfang7/stock-news-sentiment)** — a lightweight web app that analyzes financial news sentiment in real time using natural language processing.

It was designed to help investors and analysts quickly get a feel for the emotional tone of recent news headlines around a given stock or market topic.

## 🔍 What It Does

- 📥 **Fetches financial headlines** from Yahoo Finance based on a ticker
- 🧠 **Analyzes sentiment** using `TextBlob`, returning polarity and subjectivity scores
- 📊 **Visualizes results** in Streamlit with charts and color-coded tables
- 🚀 **Runs locally or in the cloud** — no API key required

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Streamlit** for rapid UI development
- **TextBlob** for sentiment scoring
- **yfinance** for headline scraping

## 💡 Why I Built It

I've always been interested in the intersection of **markets and machine learning**, and I wanted to create a tool that makes sentiment analysis accessible without needing a Bloomberg Terminal.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
- Building Streamlit apps
- Working with NLP libraries
- Structuring finance-related data pipelines
