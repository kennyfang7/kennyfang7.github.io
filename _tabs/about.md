# About Me

Hi! I’m Kenny Fang — a biomedical sciences graduate from Queen’s University with a strong foundation in IT systems, research, and automation. I have a unique blend of technical and life sciences experience, having worked in healthcare technology, research labs, and international biotech environments.

I currently work as an IT Administrator at Simply Alpha Solutions, where I help onboard and support clients for the BC Provincial Health Services Authority. I’ve delivered technical workshops, resolved hundreds of service tickets, and automated server operations using PowerShell and Python to improve reliability and efficiency.

This fall, I will be pursuing a Master of Finance at Queen’s University through the MFIN-Beijing program, a globally oriented graduate program focused on financial analytics, investment strategies, and applied economics. I look forward to bridging my technical background with a deeper understanding of financial systems and markets.

When I'm not working, I'm building this site to share thoughts, projects, and notes across tech, science, and learning.
